                    MEETING SUMMARY
============================================================

--- TRANSCRIPTION ---
 Alright, let's get started. The main focus today is finalizing our roadmap for the next two weeks, ensuring that all teams are aligned on deliverables, deadlines, and dependencies. To begin with, the backend team has completed the integration of the authentication system. OAuth 2.0 implementation is finalized, and multi-factor authentication has been tested. However, there are still a few inconsistencies when handling expired sessions. A fix is expected by Friday, and regression testing will be conducted over the weekend. Load testing reports indicate that response times under peak loads are still higher than expected. Redis caching implementation should be prioritized this week to optimize performance, with benchmarks expected by next Monday. On the frontend side, the UI for the user dashboard is 85% complete, but the settings page needs adjustments based on the latest feedback. The design team has provided revised wireframes, and the frontend engineers will begin implementing changes tomorrow, with the goal of final testing by next Wednesday. The mobile app team is also progressing well, but there have been reported issues with push notifications on iOS due to Firebase configurations. The team will sync with Firebase support tomorrow morning, and a fix should be ready by Thursday. Meanwhile, the marketing team has been preparing the pre-launch campaign. The content calendar is finalized, and the first round of social media creatives, will be shared by the end of today. The email newsletter targeting early adopters is scheduled to go out on Friday. However, we still need a landing page with a clear call to action before launching paid ads. Development of that landing page should be completed by Monday, with final copy edits by Tuesday, so the campaign can go live next Wednesday. Regarding legal and compliance, the privacy policy and terms of service drafts are under review. The legal team has flagged two areas that need attention, data retention policies and third-party API disclosures. We will need to confirm compliance with regulatory standards by the end of this week to avoid delays in approval. The finance team has also provided projections for the next quarter, and budget allocations for marketing and infrastructure upgrades have been adjusted based on recent expenses. The hiring team is also conducting interviews for the new DevOps role, with the final round scheduled for Thursday. If all goes well, we can extend an offer by next Monday, and onboarding can begin by the following week. Lastly, customer feedback from the beta program is being analyzed. There are recurring concerns about onboarding complexity, and the UX team will need to conduct additional usability tests by next Friday. Based on findings, we may need to tweak the onboarding flow before the official launch. To wrap up, let's confirm priority tasks for this week. The backend team will focus on session handling and retiscation. Thanks, everyone.
